WonderDome
==========

Codebase for the Playasophy Wonderdome project.
There are three main components to the repository.

The first is a Processing library encapsulating the input and rendering
layers of the software.

Next is the sketches themselves, which form the various 'modes'.

Finally, a minimal website provides interactive and administrative control
over the software.
