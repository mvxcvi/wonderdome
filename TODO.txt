Wonderdome TODO
===============

Critical 2015 notes
-Dude suggested looking at something called NeoPixel (similar style LED strip, may be cheaper?)

-'/log' view which dumps most recent ~100 lines of stdout and stderr (n.b. max pipe buffer size is
probably 16KB)
  -Script should save in-memory ring-buffer but also append to file
  -For ring buffer: Strip lines starting with "Updated device:"
-Wonderdome settings: FIXED_MODE, MANUAL_CYCLE, AUTO_CYCLE, RANDOM
-Hold pause for 10 seconds causes processing reboot

--- Tentative Cut Bar ---
-Re-detect NES controller if it gets disconnected
-Add audio input
-Add leapmotion input

--- Mode Ideas ---
-Columns of color
-Fire
-Barber pole
Rain (with lightning)
Bouncing ball
Test pattern - moves through each LED/color one at a time
Color sphere - up/down adjust hue of TL pixel, LR adjust saturation, A inverts colors, B ???
Game of life
Wave
Gradual color cycle
"Cloud of dots" - there is a "center point" that moves in a random walk, and each cycle a few points
are randomly picke din the "cloud" around the center to be turned on to full white; then they fade
slowly
Shifting shapes - every 2-3s a new set of colored shapes are generated
Spiral in, spiral out
Rolling primaries - RGB waves, inputs adjusts speed/brightness?
Firefly
Filters: Swap every pixel with its neighbor; rotate N degrees; Make "inside-out"
